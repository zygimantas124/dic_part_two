# Data Intelligence Challenge (2AMC15)

## Welcome

Welcome to the **Delivery Robot RL Simulation Project**!  
This repository provides a complete framework for developing, training, evaluating, and analyzing reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a simulated office environment. The primary goal is to train agents (using DQN and PPO algorithms) to deliver medication within elderly care facilities while navigating through obstacles, walls, and variable environments. The project is modular, extensible, and designed for both research and educational use.
